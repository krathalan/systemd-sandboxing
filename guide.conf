#  If true, sets up a new network namespace for the executed
#  processes and configures only the loopback network device "lo" inside it. No other
#  network devices will be available to the executed process. This is useful to turn off
#  network access by the executed process.
PrivateNetwork=yes

#  Restricts the set of socket address families accessible to the processes of this unit.
#  See address_families(7) for a list and description of each address family.
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX

#  If true, turns on IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic accounting for
#  packets sent or received by the unit. ... all IPv4 and IPv6
#  sockets created by any process of the unit are accounted for.
IPAccounting=yes

#  Turn on address range network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over
#  AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets.
# IPAddressAllow= service does not require access to any IP addresses
IPAddressDeny=any

#  Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes. In order to
#  set up an effective sandboxed environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine
#  these settings with either CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
#  SystemCallFilter=~@mount.

#  Takes a boolean argument or the special values "read-only" or "tmpfs". If true, the
#  directories /home, /root, and /run/user are made inaccessible and empty for processes
#  invoked by this unit. If set to "read-only", the three directories are made read-only
#  instead. If set to "tmpfs", temporary file systems are mounted on the three directories
#  in read-only mode. ...
#  It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services (in particular
#  network-facing ones), to ensure they cannot get access to private user data, unless the
#  services actually require access to the user's private data.
ProtectHome=yes

#  Takes a boolean argument or the special values "full" or "strict". If true, mounts the
#  /usr and the boot loader directories (/boot and /efi) read-only for processes invoked by
#  this unit. If set to "full", the /etc directory is mounted read-only, too. If set to
#  "strict" the entire file system hierarchy is mounted read-only, except for the API file
#  system subtrees /dev, /proc and /sys (protect these directories using PrivateDevices=,
#  ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=). It is recommended to enable this setting
#  for all long-running services, unless they are involved with system updates or need to
#  modify the operating system in other ways.
ProtectSystem=strict

#  Sets up a new file system namespace for executed processes. These options may be used to
#  limit access a process might have to the file system hierarchy.
ReadWritePaths=-/example/path

#  If true, sets up a new file system namespace for the executed
#  processes and mounts private /tmp and /var/tmp directories inside it that is not shared
#  by processes outside of the namespace. This is useful to secure access to temporary files
#  of the process, but makes sharing between processes via /tmp or /var/tmp impossible.
PrivateTmp=yes

###################
# User separation #
###################

#  If true, sets up a new user namespace for the executed
#  processes and configures a minimal user and group mapping, that maps the "root" user and
#  group as well as the unit's own user and group to themselves and everything else to the
#  "nobody" user and group. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases
#  used by the unit from the rest of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox
#  environment.
# PrivateUsers= service runs as root

#  If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically
#  when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped.
# DynamicUser= service runs as root

###########
# Devices #
###########

#  If true, sets up a new /dev mount for the executed processes
#  and only adds API pseudo devices such as /dev/null, /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as
#  the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it, but no physical devices such as /dev/sda, system memory
#  /dev/mem, system ports /dev/port and others. This is useful to securely turn off physical
#  device access by the executed process.
PrivateDevices=yes

#  Control access to specific device nodes by the executed processes. Takes two
#  space-separated strings: a device node specifier followed by a combination of r, w, m to
#  control reading, writing, or creation of the specific device node(s) by the unit (mknod),
#  respectively.
#  The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting
#  with /dev/, or a string starting with either "char-" or "block-" followed by a device
#  group name, as listed in /proc/devices.
DeviceAllow=/dev/exampledevice

##########
# Kernel #
##########

#  If true, kernel variables accessible through /proc/sys, /sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger,
#  /proc/latency_stats, /proc/acpi, /proc/timer_stats, /proc/fs and /proc/irq will be
#  made read-only to all processes of the unit. ... Few services need to write to these
#  at runtime; it is hence recommended to turn this on for most services.
ProtectKernelTunables=yes

#  If true, explicit module loading will be denied.
ProtectKernelModules=yes

#  If true, access to the kernel log ring buffer will be denied.
#  It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need to read from or
#  write to the kernel log ring buffer.
ProtectKernelLogs=yes

#  Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for the executed
#  process. See capabilities(7) for details.
CapabilityBoundingSet=

#  Ambient capability sets are useful if you want to execute a process as a non-privileged
#  user but still want to give it some capabilities.
# AmbientCapabilities= service runs as root

#  If true, ensures that the service process and all its children
#  can never gain new privileges through execve() (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or
#  filesystem capabilities). This is the simplest and most effective way to ensure that a
#  process and its children can never elevate privileges again.
NoNewPrivileges=yes

#  When set, sets up a new UTS namespace for the executed
#  processes. In addition, changing hostname or domainname is prevented.
ProtectHostname=yes

#  If set, writes to the hardware clock or system clock will be
#  denied. It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need modify the
#  clock.
ProtectClock=yes

#  Except for container managers no services should require write access to the control
#  groups hierarchies; it is hence recommended to turn this on for most services.
ProtectControlGroups=yes

# Restricts access to Linux namespace functionality for the processes of this unit.
RestrictNamespaces=yes

#  If set, locks down the personality(2) system call so that the
#  kernel execution domain may not be changed from the default or the personality selected
#  with Personality= directive. This may be useful to improve security, because odd
#  personality emulations may be poorly tested and source of vulnerabilities.
LockPersonality=yes

#  This option improves service security, as it makes harder for software
#  exploits to change running code dynamically. However, the protection can be circumvented,
#  if the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with noexec (such as
#  /dev/shm), or it can use memfd_create(). This can be prevented by making such file
#  systems inaccessible to the service (e.g.  InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm) and installing
#  further system call filters (SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create).
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes

#  If set, any attempts to enable realtime scheduling in a process of the unit are refused.
#  ... Realtime
#  scheduling policies may be used to monopolize CPU time for longer periods of time, and
#  may hence be used to lock up or otherwise trigger Denial-of-Service situations on the
#  system. It is hence recommended to restrict access to realtime scheduling to the few
#  programs that actually require them.
RestrictRealtime=yes

#  If set, any attempts to set the set-user-ID (SUID) or
#  set-group-ID (SGID) bits on files or directories will be denied. ... As the
#  SUID/SGID bits are mechanisms to elevate privileges, and allows users to acquire the
#  identity of other users, it is recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the
#  few programs that actually require them.
RestrictSUIDSGID=yes

#  If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user
#  and group the processes of this unit are run as are removed when the unit is stopped.
#  This setting only has an effect if at least one of User=, Group= and DynamicUser= are
#  used. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by the root user.
# RemoveIPC= service runs as root

# System calls #
################

#  Use systemd-analyze syscall-filter to list the actual list of
#  system calls in each filter. ... If this setting is used, all system
#  calls executed by the unit processes except for the listed ones will result in immediate
#  process termination with the SIGSYS signal (whitelisting).
#  If the first character of the list is "~", the effect is inverted: only the listed
#  system calls will result in immediate process termination (blacklisting).
SystemCallFilter=@system-service
SystemCallFilter=~@resources @privileged

#  Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call
#  filter. ... The special identifier native implicitly maps to the native
#  architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is
#  compiled for).
